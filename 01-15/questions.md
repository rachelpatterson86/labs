In this assignment, we'll revisit and refactor
[our previous tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/TIY-ATL-ROR-2015-Jan/labs/tree/master/01-08/questions.md)
implementation with an eye towards testability, maintainability,
object oriented design, and code quality.

Your work should be pushed to Github by Tuesday at 8am.

**Incomplete work that is on time and later refined is preferred to late work that is complete and bug-free.**

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand basic OO principles
* Appreciate the difficulty of changing code, and think about ways to make it easier

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* `class`es (and potentially subclasses/inheritance) to encapsulate logic

## Details

### Deliverables

In the 01-15 directory of the labs repo...

* a `tic-tac-toe.rb` script
* any other files required by that script

### Requirements

* Running `./tic-tac-toe.rb` should play a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal.
* No `rubocop` errors. Less than 10 `rubocop` warnings.

## Normal Mode

* A swappable `Player` class, which can be `Human` (gets input from
  the command line) or `Random`. It should be possible to run a game
  with anywhere from 0 to 2 human players.
* An option to play again after the game is over.

## Hard Mode

Choose any of:

* Add a Win-Loss-Draw scoreboard that displays after each game.
* At least 2 tests for every method.

## Notes

Think about your previous solution. Is it reusable, or is it better to
start from scratch? Were there things you could have done then to make
it easier to adapt now? Are there things you can do now which might
make it easier to adapt this code in the future?
