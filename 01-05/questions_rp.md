## Have a look on Ruby Doc at the methods defined on strings and symbols.  ## Describe 2 methods that strings have but symbols don't and vice versa.  ## Pick a method defined on the Enumerable class (arrays, etc). What does it do and when might you use it?

String methods:
1- .chop => removes last character of string, creating new string that may replace old one.
2- .clear => empties a value for the var that contaings a string

Symbol methods:
1- .all_symbols => returns all symbols as an array under Ruby's symbol table
2- .empty? => boolean. returns of value is empty aka ""

Array method:
1 - .drops[x] => gets rid of the first x elements in an array. NOT count by  index, elements.
